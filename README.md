 Project Overview:


 This project aims to create a website where we can exchange one cryptocurrency to other(for example from Bitcoin to Ethereum). We can choose to change any number of coins we want(for example if I have 45 BTC in my wallet, I can choose to exchange 20 BTC to ETH, the rest of the coins remain in BTC).



 
 
 Features:


 Reads live market data. Available in the 'Rates' section. CoinGecko API is used to read live market data. This website also tracks changes over a 24 hour period. The data is updated once in every minute.

 The 'Exchange' section contains the interface where we can exchange cryptocurrencies. This section is Front-end only due to time-constraints.

 The 'Login' and 'Signup' are also Front-end only.

 Follows Single-Page Application (SPA) Architecture which has the following advantages:
 No page reloads when navigating
 Smooth transitions between sections
 Preserves JavaScript state

 Has responsive design. Works on all device sizes. Feature cards stack on mobile.

 Navigation has made easier by active link highlighting, underline animation and proper page titles.

 Has good visual animations for a polished look.
